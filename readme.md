# Sidesaver - A Simple Backup Engine
*Sidesaver* is a simple Windows application for creating iterative backup saves in programs that don't natively support that (ex. Adobe Photoshop).

When you launch Sidesaver, you can add as many files to its watch list as you like. You can minimize it to the system tray if you do not like having the window open. To remove watched files, right-click them in the watch list and remove them from there.

Sidesaver will run in the background while you work. Everytime you save, it will copy the file, and save the new copy as a backup. In its current state, it will simply save up to 5 backup copies, numbered 1-5 where 1 is the most recent and 5 is the oldest.

In the future, this will be configurable, as will the save location (currently, it just saves the backups side-by-side with the original).
